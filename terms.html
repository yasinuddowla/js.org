    <h1>Terms and Conditions of
        <strong>JS.ORG</strong></h1>

    <h3>§ 1 Principles</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>JS.ORG is a free service provided by the owner of JS.ORG as stated in the imprint. The service will be only called
            "JS.ORG". All services are incumbent upon these terms and conditions.</li>
        <li>JS.ORG accompanies and extends the service "GitHub Pages" provided by GitHub, Inc ("GitHub"). JS.ORG provides free
            subdomains underneath the domain "js.org" to be used as a custom URL for a GitHub Page.</li>
        <li>The Terms of the GitHub service and all rights of GitHub, Inc remain unaffected by the terms of JS.ORG.</li>
        <li>Communication between JS.ORG and the user will take place on GitHub in the form of issues, pull requests or comments.</li>
        <li>By submitting a pull request in the GitHub repo that accompanies and hosts JS.ORG with the wish to add a record to
            the list of domains, the user attends the JS.ORG service and accepts the terms and conditions as the sole basis
            of all services provided by JS.ORG.</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>§ 2 Availability and reservations</h3>
    <p>JS.ORG aims to ensure the constant availability of the subdomain service. A right on constant availability does not exist.
        All services in connection with this free service will be provided on a voluntary basis. The user acquires no ownership
        or other rights to single services, the registered subdomains and the whole service.</p>
    <p>If the user violates the terms, JS.ORG is entitled to exclude the user from the service without notice subjected to damages
        and other claims. JS.ORG is entitled to terminate or modify the service at any time without notice and without explanation.

        <li>The user cancels the service by removing the CNAME file in their repository and making a pull request in the repository
            of JS.ORG with the wish to remove their subdomain from the list of active JS.ORG domains.</li>
        <li>JS.ORG may also terminate the provision of a certain or all subdomains. Concerned users will be notified at least
            7 days in advance by an issue in their GitHub repository</li>
    </ol>

        <li>File or Image hosting</li>
        <li>Sites with other illegal content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A violation of these rules will result in immediate deletion of the JS.ORG domain.</p>

    <h3>§ 5 Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In principle JS.ORG takes no responsability for the support. The use of the provided services of JS.ORG takes place
            at your own risk. This refers in particular to the functionality, availability and freedom from viruses of the
            provided services as well as damage caused by the use of programs, program components and scripts/applets. The
            user is obliged to create local copies of all his data at JS.ORG for security reasons and regularly to secure
            all stored data. JS.ORG indicates that JS.ORG is a free service and does not create data backups for the users.</li>
        <li>The user is liable for any use of the service performed by his GitHub user account. Legal representatives are liable
            for minors. The user therefore has to ensure that his access can not be misused by third parties.</li>
        <li>JS.ORG provides the service without any express or implied warranties. JS.ORG is not liable for inadvertent disclosure,
            damage or loss of transmitted, received or stored data from JS.ORG. The user expressly acknowledges that these
            terms also effect third party supplies.</li>
        <li>For the purposed service usage as described above JS.ORG solely assume the liability for the injury to life, limb
            and health, and other damages caused by gross neglect of duty on JS.ORG</li>
        <li>A liability of JS.ORG for slight negligence exists only for breach of an essential contractual obligation</li>
        <li>A liability of JS.ORG for further damages, in particular consequential damages, indirect damages or lost profits
            is excluded.</li>
        <li>A liability for malfunctions or failure as well as unauthorized access from outside the sphere of influence of JS.ORG
            is only in the context of intent and gross negligence.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>§ 6 Name of the subdomain</h3>
    <p>Each user can select the names of subdomains in accordance to the URL provided by the GitHub Pages service and with respect
        to a public available list of restricted names published in the JS.ORG repository. It is sole responsibility of the
        user to consider whether the name is contrary to statutory provisions, third party rights (including trade marks
        or registered rights), or morality. If this is the case, the registration of the subdomain is to be omitted. The
        same applies to subdomains, whose name is misleading, or suspect websites which are excluded of the participation
        in the service because of their content according to § 4.</p>


    <h3>§ 7 Absolute ban of spam</h3>
    <p>References to domains registered at JS.ORG in unsolicited commercial e-mail or similar media (spam) are not allowed.
        The mass registering of domains for the purpose of irritation to the users of search engines are also considered
        spam and are also inadmissible.</p>


    <h3>§ 8 Manipulation</h3>
    <p>It is prohibited to auto retrieve masses of JS.ORG subdomains.</p>


    <h3>§ 9 Responsibility</h3>
    <p>JS.ORG is not responsible for the names of subdomains or the content of external websites that are registered as link
        destinations of subdomains, or otherwise linked to this service.</p>


    <h3>§ 10 Place of jurisdiction</h3>
    <p>Service provision and the usage of the service according to these terms and conditions is exclusively subject to the
        application of the law of the Federal Republic of Germany. Application of conflict of laws of private international
        law is expressly excluded.</p>
    <p>The place of jurisdiction for JS.ORG is Munich, the residence of the owner of JS.ORG as stated in the legals.</p>
    <p>For disputes with users who are defined as contractors after §14 BGB, Munich is agreed as place of jurisdiction. For
        users who do not have general jurisdiction and no resident in Germany at the time of the commencement of proceedings,
        Munich will be the place of jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>For users, who are consumers within the meaning. § 13 BGB, the general jurisdiction of the domicile will remain in Munich.</p>


    <h3>§ 11 Change of Terms</h3>
    <p>JS.ORG reserves the right to make changes to the Terms of Service. The user will be informed by JS.ORG of the changes
        through a notice in the readme section of the JS.ORG repository.</p>


    <h3>§ 12 Severability clause</h3>
